<h1> Flask_hands_on </h1>

This project was created as part of my learning journey during my night skill sessions in college.  Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python  

I have separated my learnings into several parts and the corresponding code is present inside a separate folder in the repository .

----------

To set up the Flask application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone 

2. Navigate into the project directory:

       cd flask_hands_on

3. Install the required dependencies:

       pip install flask 

4. Run the Flask application:

       python app.py
