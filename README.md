<h1> Flask_hands_on </h1>

This project was created as part of my learning journey during my night skill sessions in college.  Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python  

I have separated my learnings into several parts and the corresponding code is present inside a separate folder in the repository .

----------

To set up the Flask application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone "https://github.com/Krishnacoder528/flask_hands_on.git"

2. Navigate into the project directory:

       cd flask_hands_on

3. Setup the Virtual Environment

       py -m venv env (or) virtualenv env

4. Activate the Virtual environment

       env/Scripts/Activate

5. Install the required dependencies:

       pip install flask

6. Move to Respective Folder (Part)
   
       cd Part 2 or Part 3 (Corresponding Part  u wish to move)

7. Run the Flask application:

       python app.py (Note : .py file name varies from part to part )
   
9. Deactivate the environment

       env/Scripts/deactivate
